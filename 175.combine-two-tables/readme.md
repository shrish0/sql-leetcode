Certainly! Here's a basic `README.md` template that you can use for a project involving a MySQL query and related tasks. You can customize this template based on your specific project.

# MySQL Query Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use MySQL to query data from relational tables. The primary focus is on performing various types of JOIN operations between two tables, `address` and `person`, and retrieving specific fields.

## Prerequisites
To run the queries in this project, you will need:
- MySQL installed on your system
- A basic understanding of SQL
- Access to a MySQL database containing the `address` and `person` tables

## Database Schema
The project assumes the following simplified schema for demonstration:

### `address` Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description                   |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| addressId   | INT       | Primary key for the address table |
| personId    | INT       | Foreign key linked to `person` table |
| city        | VARCHAR   | City of the address            |
| state       | VARCHAR   | State of the address           |

### `person` Table
| Column Name | Data Type | Description                     |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| personId    | INT       | Primary key for the person table |
| firstName   | VARCHAR   | First name of the person         |
| lastName    | VARCHAR   | Last name of the person          |

## SQL Queries
### Example Query: Left Outer Join
The following query selects all addresses and matches them with persons based on `personId`. If a match is not found, it still includes the address with `NULL` values for the person's details.

```sql
SELECT a.addressId, p.personId, a.city, a.state 
FROM address AS a 
LEFT OUTER JOIN person AS p 
ON a.personId = p.personId 
ORDER BY a.addressId;
```

### Example Query: Right Outer Join
This query selects all persons and matches them with addresses based on `personId`. If a match is not found, it includes the person with `NULL` values for the address details.

```sql
SELECT a.addressId, p.personId, a.city, a.state 
FROM address AS a 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN person AS p 
ON a.personId = p.personId 
ORDER BY a.addressId;
```
